## Problem
#### Create a plain HTML page for B. Sc. Hons CS course, mentioning details like fee, eligibility criteria, papers with names and credits, and future possibilities after the course. A button for styling should be there at bottom of the page. On clicking on this button JavaScript should redesign the complete page using jQuery in a nice presentable way.
